# Project Description

Problem:
In many communities, individuals and small businesses often struggle to find skilled professionals for tasks such as plumbing, electrical work, carpentry, or other trades. Traditional methods like word-of-mouth referrals or local classifieds are inefficient, unreliable, and lack transparency. As a result, people face difficulties in connecting with trusted service providers, while skilled workers miss opportunities to showcase their expertise and expand their customer base.

Solution:
Our project aims to build a website that connects people in need of trade services with skilled professionals who can provide them. Users will be able to create accounts, browse available trades, post service requests, and connect with tradespeople in their area. Service providers can showcase their skills, manage job requests, and build credibility through ratings and reviews. This platform will create a transparent, convenient, and user-friendly system for both parties, bridging the gap between demand and supply in local trade services.

Technologies:
The solution will be implemented using React for the frontend to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. The Node.js/Express framework will serve as the backend to manage APIs and business logic, while MongoDB will be used for database storage of users, job listings, and requests. Authentication and authorization will be implemented to ensure secure access. Additional tools like Git/GitHub for version control and Postman for API testing will also be utilized.
